# EDS Unit Test Build script
#
# For consistent unit testing we will use a custom XML data definition, NOT the one from the active mission
# This gives a couple advantages -
#  - The custom XML files can be crafted to exercise as many features as possible, regardless of
#    what is actively in use in the current mission
#  - The edslib unit test should not break when the active mission XML is updated.
