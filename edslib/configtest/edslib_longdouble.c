**  This is a configuration test file used by the build system to determine
**  the level of floating point type support of the compiler and C library.
**
**  For the Pack/Unpack routines in EdsLib it is beneficial to use the maximum
**  precision that is possible using the native FPU.  C99 defined the "long double"
**  type and other systems may even have some form of quad type.
**
**  On the other end of the spectrum, embedded microcontrollers may not even
**  support any sort of extended-precision type at all.
**
**  At the moment this checks if we can compile a simple function that uses
**  the long double type.  If this succeeds then it is assumed that the system
**  has a functional "long double" implementation.  Otherwise a standard "double"
**  can be used instead.
