# CFE/CFS build utility tools makefile
# This will build cFE/CFS EDS generator tools.
#
# These tools require the "expat" library, so the "-dev" or "-devel"
# package for the host machine should be installed.
#
# Note this is built natively on the build machine for use during compilation -
# none of this code is loaded directly onto the target.  The output of these
# tools are linked into the final executables, but there is no dependency
# on expat in the final binaries.
