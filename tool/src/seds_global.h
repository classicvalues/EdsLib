 * Defines type abstractions that apply to the entire EDS conversion/build process.
 *
 * Note that this tool library does NOT use OSAL -- this is built and executed
 * before osal ever enters the picture.  It only runs on the build/host machine
 * so there should not be any issues using the C library headers directly.
 *
 * That being said, this should still be portable to any other system out there
 * that implements basic POSIX/XOpen standards (Cygwin, OSX, BSD) and has a Lua
 * version 5.2 interpreter available.
