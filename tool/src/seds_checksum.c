 *
 * Implementation file for the checksum module.
 *
 * This is essentially a hash function computed on the specific binary
 * representation of EDS-defined objects.  If the binary representation ever
 * changes, the hash should change in an unpredictable way.  Likewise, if
 * two EDS binary representations are exactly identical the hash should also
 * be the same value.
 *
 * The algorithm is based on CRC, but expanded to 64 bits to reduce the chance
 * of a random collision.
 *
 * This has two purposes:
 *  1) Avoid creating duplicate output in generated files (if two object checksums
 *     are equal, then the definition may not need to be repeated).
 *  2) Verify compatibility between stored data and data definitions.  If the checksum
 *     is stored with the original data at the time it is saved, this can be compared
 *     against the data definition at the time it is loaded.  If the values are different
 *     than it is likely that the definition does not match the actual data, which
 *     would suggest that the loaded data would not be correct.
 *
 * @Note this hash is intended to protect against common use cases and operator errors.
 * This is not a cryptographic hash function and is not intended to replace a
 * secure signature for EDS objects for those applications that require it.
 *
 * Also note, if the checksum algorithm implementation ever changes, it will invalidate
 * all the checksums in any previously stored files.  This algorithm should be changed
 * with great care if any existing binary files may need to be preserved.
